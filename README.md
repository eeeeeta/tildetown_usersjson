tilde.town users.json generator
===============================

This is a more modern version of the users.py script from [tildetown_ring](https://github.com/aBathologist/tildetown_ring),
made for the [tilde.town](https://tilde.town/) intentional digital community.

If you don't know what tilde.town is, this isn't very interesting to you.
If you do, check out [the users.json file](http://tilde.town/~eeeeeta/users.json)
that this thing makes!
